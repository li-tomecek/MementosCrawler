# Apex of the Arcane

'Apex of the Arcane' is a personal project intended to familiarize myself with the game engine Unity and C# scripting, as well as applying AI techniques to in-game enemies. The game is played in a simple
top-down, 2D, environment with grid-based movement.

## Description

In this rogue-like game, the player will control a cast of wizards as they traverse through a series of rooms in an arcane dungeon, each containing a turn-based strategy minigame. Player and enemy units alike
must determine how to best utilize their offensive and defensive spells, melee attacks, and other moves to elimiate their opponents while managing their own heath and sp (spell points).

At present, the enemy will mathematically model each of their combat options during their turn: attacking an enemy in range with a specific attack, healing an ally in range, moving towards enemy units that are out of range, etc.\
While the above clip shows the genaral flow of combat, there is still a long way to go in terms of polishing combat, creating different maps, and implementing rewards and growth for player characters!
